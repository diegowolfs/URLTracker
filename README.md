# URLTracker

This solution will track all links from a given URL. 
For Example:
If you use https://www.ibm.com/br-pt/ for Input, all url with tag a as href will be tracked and the system will track again all URL´s for each "Child" URL.

- The app needs to receive an URL;
- The app will find all links inside this given URL;
- The app will save this links found in database (H2)
- The app will list all links saved in the database.
- After collecting all links from the initial URL. Collect from the newly found links. I mean, the system gets the first link saved, and start the process (get all links and keep on the database). Follow does it to the second, third and successively until the last link saved and tracked.
